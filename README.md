# Fraud-Detection
Fraud transaction detection for banking industry

In banking sector fraud has become one of the leading issues that they are trying to stop for the past 100 years.

# Problem Statement:
To Identify the fraudulent behavior based on various transactions performed by the customers.

This problem of fraud detection is framed as classification problems —predicting a discrete class label output given a data observation. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

This dataset contains various transactions that occurred, where we have 610 frauds out of 1372 transactions. The dataset is fairly balanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 44% of all transactions.

The dataset provided is a valuable training and testing ground for supervised machine learning to try and develop models that can identify patterns of fraud from the features within the data.

We will use detection algorithms and identify transactions with a high probability of being fraudulent.

The ultimate goal of analyzing the dataset is to be able to predict cases of fraud or unsafe practices far in advance, so those responsible can be punished, and those who are innocent are not harmed.
